# OarByte
Mobile application for coaches and launch drivers tracking a rowing crew, to recieve data on the stroke rate, and the average split.

## Stroke Rate
Stroke rate will be determined by the user tapping a large touch area on the app.
-> Another method might be picking up audio signals (e.g. the user giving audible beeps with their voice)

## Average speed
Will be based off of the previous X seconds of GPS data.
-> future additions might be to add / subtract the average water flow if it's a river, from an API.
This is to combat the pace differential, where you see vastly different splits. It gives much more representative splits data.
